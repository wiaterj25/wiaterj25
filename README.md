## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am here to learn computer software for my computer science minor.  
I am studying to become and electrical engineer, so computer science skills are highly valuable for my education and future performance as an engineer.
In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family, friends, and my two wiener dogs.  
To stay active, I enjoy swimming, weightlifting, and cycling.
I am excited to learn more about what GitHub has to offer.
